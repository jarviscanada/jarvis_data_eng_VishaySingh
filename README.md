# Vishay Singh . Jarvis Consulting

Hello there! My name is Vishay Singh and I graduated from the University of Toronto with an Honours 
Bachelor's Degree of Science, majoring in Computer Science and French Studies. Since a young age, I've
been fascinated by what technology can do to solve real world problems, which is exactly what I want 
to do in the software industry. In fact, learning new things is a passion of mine, so software provides 
the perfect avenue to continually challenge myself. In my spare time, I'm either building computers, 
playing video games, or learning guitar.

**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VishaySingh/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Designed, implemented, tested, and deployed a Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent that allows businesses 
to monitor and find server nodes that are underperforming, resulting in optimized resource allocation 
for the entire cluster.


**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VishaySingh/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: In progress.
  - JDBC App: Designed, implemented, tested, and deployed a Java app that uses the JDBC library, the DAO design pattern, a Docker PostgreSQL database, IntelliJ IDE, and DBeaver client to CRUD persisted sales data, resulting in atomic business-related queries.
  - Grep App: Designed, implemented, tested, and deployed a Java implementation of the Linux grep command using features/libraries (like regex, lambda, Stream APIs, and JUnit), which recursively traverses file paths resulting in an output file with all matching strings.
