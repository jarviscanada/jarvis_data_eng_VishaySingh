# Vishay Singh . Jarvis Consulting

Hello there! My name is Vishay Singh and I graduated from the University of Toronto with an Honours 
Bachelor's Degree of Science, majoring in Computer Science and French Studies. Since a young age, I've
been fascinated by what technology can do to solve real world problems, which is exactly what I want 
to do in the software industry. In fact, learning new things is a passion of mine, so software provides 
the perfect avenue to continually challenge myself. This mindset lead to my projects at Jarvis, which includes
a Linux/SQL server usage bot, a Java grep implementation & JDBC app, a Twitter CRD backend app, and a fullstack React.js
& SpringBoot trading app. Before Jarvis, I was involved in different projects like a MERN stack web app, an RNN generative song lyric
model, and a lecture/tutorial on rootkits with respect to cybersecurity. In my spare time, I'm either building computers, 
playing video games, or learning guitar.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VishaySingh](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VishaySingh)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VishaySingh/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Designed, implemented, tested, and deployed a Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent that allows businesses 
to monitor and find server nodes that are underperforming, resulting in optimized resource allocation 
for the entire cluster.


**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VishaySingh/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Designed, implemented, tested, and deployed a backend Java app that can CRD tweets using Twitter's REST API. Common design patterns & frameworks were leveraged to design this app, such as MVC architecture, DAOs, and Spring Dependency Injection. Implemented using HTTP client, core Java libraries, maven, and SpringBoot. Integration and Unit testing using JUnit and Mockito, resulted in a well-tested app published on DockerHub.
  - JDBC App: Designed, implemented, tested, and deployed a Java app that uses the JDBC library, the DAO design pattern, a Docker PostgreSQL database, IntelliJ IDE, and DBeaver client to CRUD persisted sales data, resulting in atomic business-related queries.
  - Grep App: Designed, implemented, tested, and deployed a Java implementation of the Linux grep command using features/libraries (like regex, lambda, Stream APIs, and JUnit), which recursively traverses file paths resulting in an output file with all matching strings.

**Springboot App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VishaySingh/tree/master/springboot)]: Designed, implemented, tested, and deployed a backend trading app that can create
and manage clients/accounts, and execute security orders on stocks defined by IEX Cloud's REST 
API. This app leverages three-tier architecture, microservices, and DAO design patterns. It was written
with standard Java libraries, SpringBoot Inversion of Control, SwaggerUI, PostgreSQL external 
databases, Maven, and deployed using Docker.


**Frontend/React** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VishaySingh/tree/master/frontend)]: Designed, implemented, tested, and deployed a frontend app that built upon the SpringBoot project's backend which
provides traders a clean UI where they can add accounts, check stock quotes, and read/update their account info. 
All components were built using React.js, styled using S/CSS, managed using NPM, tested in the browser, and deployed 
using Docker.


**Cloud/DevOps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_VishaySingh/tree/master/cloud_devops)]: In progress.


## Highlighted Projects
**Google Developer Student Club Website** [[GitHub](https://github.com/UTSCCSCC01/finalprojectw22-GDSC2.0)]: Designed, implemented, and tested an MVC architecture web application using the MERN 
stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) in a team of 6.


**Deep Learning - RNN Lyric Generation Model** [[GitHub](https://github.com/V35games/Lyric-Generation-Model)]: Designed, implemented, trained, and tested an RNN Generative Model to achieve a 58% test accuracy.


**Information Security - Rootkit Lecture and Tutorial** [[GitHub](https://github.com/V35games/CSC427-LD_PRELOAD-Rootkit)]: Collaborated with a partner to create an in-depth presentation, lab, and assignment about rootkits 
that exploit the Linux LD_PRELOAD environment variable.



## Professional Experiences

**Software Engineer (Bilingual / Entry Level), Jarvis (2022-present)**: Designed, implemented, tested, and deployed software projects relating to Linux/Bash scripting,
