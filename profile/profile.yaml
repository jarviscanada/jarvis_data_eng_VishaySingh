summary: |
  Hello there! My name is Vishay Singh and I graduated from the University of Toronto with an Honours 
  Bachelor's Degree of Science, majoring in Computer Science and French Studies. Since a young age, I've
  been fascinated by what technology can do to solve real world problems, which is exactly what I want 
  to do in the software industry. In fact, learning new things is a passion of mine, so software provides 
  the perfect avenue to continually challenge myself. In my spare time, I'm either building computers, 
  playing video games, or learning guitar.
