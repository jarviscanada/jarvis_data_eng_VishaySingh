summary: |
  Hello there! My name is Vishay Singh and I graduated from the University of Toronto with an Honours 
  Bachelor's Degree of Science, majoring in Computer Science and French Studies. Since a young age, I've
  been fascinated by what technology can do to solve real world problems, which is exactly what I want 
  to do in the software industry. In fact, learning new things is a passion of mine, so software provides 
  the perfect avenue to continually challenge myself. This mindset lead to my projects at Jarvis, which includes
  a Linux/SQL server usage bot, a Java grep implementation & JDBC app, a Twitter CRD backend app, and a fullstack React.js
  & SpringBoot trading app. Before Jarvis, I was involved in different projects like a MERN stack web app, an RNN generative song lyric
  model, and a lecture/tutorial on rootkits with respect to cybersecurity. In my spare time, I'm either building computers, 
  playing video games, or learning guitar.

    description: |
      Designed, implemented, tested, and deployed a Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent that allows businesses 
      to monitor and find server nodes that are underperforming, resulting in optimized resource allocation 
      for the entire cluster.
  - name: "Core Java Apps"
    git_url: "/core_java"
    description:
      - "Twitter App: Designed, implemented, tested, and deployed a backend Java app that can CRD 
      tweets using Twitter's REST API. Common design patterns & frameworks were leveraged to 
      design this app, such as MVC architecture, DAOs, and Spring Dependency Injection. Implemented
      using HTTP client, core Java libraries, maven, and SpringBoot. Integration and Unit testing using
      JUnit and Mockito, resulted in a well-tested app published on DockerHub."
      - "JDBC App: Designed, implemented, tested, and deployed a Java app that uses the JDBC library, 
      the DAO design pattern, a Docker PostgreSQL database, IntelliJ IDE, and DBeaver client to CRUD
      persisted sales data, resulting in atomic business-related queries."
      - "Grep App: Designed, implemented, tested, and deployed a Java implementation of the Linux grep
      command using features/libraries (like regex, lambda, Stream APIs, and JUnit), which recursively 
      traverses file paths resulting in an output file with all matching strings."
  - name: "Springboot App"
    git_url: "/springboot"
    description: |
      Designed, implemented, tested, and deployed a backend trading app that can create
      and manage clients/accounts, and execute security orders on stocks defined by IEX Cloud's REST 
      API. This app leverages three-tier architecture, microservices, and DAO design patterns. It was written
      with standard Java libraries, SpringBoot Inversion of Control, SwaggerUI, PostgreSQL external 
      databases, Maven, and deployed using Docker.

    description: |
      Designed, implemented, tested, and deployed a frontend app that built upon the SpringBoot project's backend which
      provides traders a clean UI where they can add accounts, check stock quotes, and read/update their account info. 
      All components were built using React.js, styled using S/CSS, managed using NPM, tested in the browser, and deployed 
      using Docker.
