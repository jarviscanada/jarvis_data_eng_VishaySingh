# Introduction
(50-100 words)
What does this app do? What technologies you have used? (e.g. Twitter REST API, HTTP client, mvn, Java libs, docker etc..)
This app aims at providing a backend that can CRUD (Create, Read, Update*, and Delete) tweets using Twitterâ€™s REST API v1. Common design patterns & frameworks were leveraged to design this app, such as MVC architecture, DAOs, and Spring Dependency Injection. It accomplishes this task by using HTTP client, core Java libraries, maven, and SpringBoot. Furthermore, this app is published on DockerHub.

*Note that Twitter does not allow for updating tweets.
