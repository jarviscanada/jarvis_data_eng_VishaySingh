# Introduction
This project aims at developing skills/knowledge using the JDBC library, and the DAO and repository design patterns. The app was built using Docker for hosting the PostgreSQL database, IntelliJ as the IDE, DBeaver client for database visualization and ERD diagram, and core java libraries. The result is an app that leverages the DAO design pattern to CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) relevant information stored in the Docker PostgreSQL database. 

# Implementation
## ER Diagram

## Design Patterns
Discuss DAO and Repository design patterns (150-200 words)

# Test
How you test your app against the database? (e.g. database setup, test data set up, query result)
